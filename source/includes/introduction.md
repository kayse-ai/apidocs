# Introduction

Welcome to the Kayse Public API documentation! Our API enables you to interact with Kayse's endpoints, providing access to various functionalities available on our platform.

On the left, you'll find detailed information about each endpoint, including descriptions, methods, URLs, and request/response schemas. The right side features example requests (via cURL) and corresponding JSON responses. We plan to expand this documentation with additional endpoints to offer comprehensive access to the Kayse database.

If this is your first time using our API, start by reviewing the **Authentication** section to learn how to obtain and use API keys.

For updates and changes, refer to the **Changelog** section.
